Application description: This is an Android app based on preferences and combinations with the intent to help people find roommates. The user selects their settings, accepted roomie distance, etc. and then waits for the application to search its data and combine them with potential roommates. Once a combination has been established, either user has the option to start a conversation to see if they would make good living roomies. It is highly recommended that any potential roomies deciding on moving in together should first meet in person before living with one another.
